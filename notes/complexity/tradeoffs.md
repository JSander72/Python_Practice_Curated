# Complexity Tradeoffs

- Arrays: Fast access, slow insert/delete
- Linked Lists: Slow access, fast insert/delete
- Stacks/Queues: Fast push/pop, FIFO/LIFO
- Hash Tables: Fast average lookup, possible collisions
- Trees: Fast search if balanced, slow if unbalanced
- Sorting: Tradeoff between speed, memory, and stability
