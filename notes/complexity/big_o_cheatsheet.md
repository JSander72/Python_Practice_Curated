# Big-O Cheatsheet (Quick Glance)

- Hash lookup: average **O(1)**, worst **O(n)** with collisions
- Binary search (sorted array): **O(log n)**
- Merge/Quick sort: **O(n log n)** average
- Bubble/Insertion/Selection: **O(nÂ²)**
- BST operations: **O(log n)** if balanced; **O(n)** if skewed
- Queue/Stack ops: **O(1)**
- Array insert/delete (middle): **O(n)**; at end amortized **O(1)** (dynamic arrays)
