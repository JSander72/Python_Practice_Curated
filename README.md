# Python Practice Curated

A comprehensive, assessment-ready Python bootcamp resource. This repository is designed for hands-on learning, interview prep, and coding assessments. All files are short, focused, and runnable from the CLI (`python file.py`). Each topic is covered with practical, well-commented code and real-world problem examples.

## Structure

- **basics/** – Python fundamentals (loops, lists, if/else, slicing, dicts/sets)
- **beginner/** – Step-by-step beginner exercises (01–10 style, user input, logic, functions)
- **intermediate/**
- **data_structures/** – Arrays, singly/doubly linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, and more
- **algorithms/** – Classic algorithms: search, sort, recursion, dynamic programming, greedy, etc. OOP, modules, IO, logging, and SDK usage
- **leetcode/** – LeetCode-style problems with docstring tests and optimal solutions
- **datasets/** – Sample CSVs and data files for practice
- **notes/complexity/** – Big-O cheatsheets, trade-offs, and quick reference guides

## Highlights

- **Assessment Ready:** Covers all major data structures and algorithms required for coding interviews and bootcamps.
- **Runnable Examples:** Every file is executable and self-contained.
- **Modern Python:** Uses type hints, `__future__` imports, and idiomatic code.
- **Breadth & Depth:** From array ops and linked lists to dynamic programming and greedy algorithms.
- **LeetCode Section:** Real-world coding challenges with clear, concise solutions.

## Usage

- Use Python 3.10+.
- (Recommended) Create a virtual environment:
bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate

- Run any file directly:
bash
python path/to/file.py

- Many files include a `main()` for quick testing.

## Topics Covered

- Arrays, Linked Lists (singly/doubly), Stacks, Queues (array, linked, circular, two-stack)
- Trees (binary, BST), Hash Tables (chaining)
- Sorting: Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Merge, Quick
- Searching: Linear, Binary
- Recursion, Memoization, Dynamic Programming (Fibonacci, Climb Stairs, Coin Change, Knapsack)
- Greedy Algorithms (Activity Selection, Fractional Knapsack)
- LeetCode: Two Sum, Valid Parentheses, Merge Arrays, Max Depth Binary Tree, Best Time to Buy/Sell Stock, Climb Stairs, and more
- Complexity analysis and trade-offs

## Notes

- See `notes/complexity/` for Big-O and trade-off summaries.
- All code is heavily commented for clarity.
- Suitable for self-study, bootcamp prep, and technical interviews.

## Run Tips

- Use Python 3.10+
- Prefer a virtual env: `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
- Each file has a `main()` you can run directly.
