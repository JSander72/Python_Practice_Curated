# Python Practice Curated

A clean, learn-by-doing collection. Files are short, heavily commented, and runnable from the CLI (`python file.py`).

## Structure
- **basics/** – fundamentals (loops, lists, if/else, slicing, dicts/sets)
- **beginner/** – step-by-step beginner exercises (01–10 style)
- **intermediate/** – larger topics (OOP, modules, IO, logging, simple SDK usage)
- **leetcode/** – problem-solving experiments with docstring tests
- **datasets/** – sample files used by scripts/notebooks

## Run Tips
- Use Python 3.10+
- Prefer a virtual env: `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
- Each file has a `main()` you can run directly.
